This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.

Currently in progress.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### NPM layer
Run `npm start` for the same behaviour.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
A watcher is set by default to update the build and rerun tests.

Run `ng test --single-run` if you wish to run the test only once.

### NPM layer
Run `npm test:watch` for the same behaviour.
Run `npm test` for a single run with code coverage

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
